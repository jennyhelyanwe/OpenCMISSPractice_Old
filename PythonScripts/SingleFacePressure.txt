0. Initialise OpenCMISS 
Set error handling as TRAP_ERROR, and turn all levels of diagnostic testing on. 

1. Coordinate system
RC

2. Region. 

3. Basis functions
Set up one linear basis for interpolation of hydrostatic pressure and one cubic basis function for interpolation of geometry. 

4. Mesh
Set up a generated regular mesh (rectangular/cuboid) and give the global measurements of the cube as well as the number of elements in each global direction. 

5. Decomposition
standard 

6. Geometric field
standard

7. Fibre Field
30 degrees fibre to xi1 direction. 

8. Material Field
Attach material field to geometric field. Using transverse isotropic exponential constitutive model. This model has 5 coefficients. Set them to be 2,5,10,0,5.

9. Dependent Field
Create dependent field with type: geometric_general. This field has 2 variables, one for the non derivative value, and one for the du/dn value. Each variable has 4 components, three for the geometry, and a fourth component for the hydrostatic pressure interpolation - this value is set to -8.0. The dependent field is initialised with the undeformed geometries from the geometric field. 

10. Equation Set

11. Problem
standard

12. Boundary Condition
Apply a pressure loading of -1.5 kPa on the right face. Fix the left face in all directions.
