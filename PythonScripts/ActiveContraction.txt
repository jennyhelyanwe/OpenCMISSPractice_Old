This script uses a tricubic hermite unit cube, with trilinear interpolation of hydrostatic pressure. 

The bases, mesh, decomposition, and geometric field are all standard. 

1. Fibre Field
30 degrees fibre to xi1 direction, constant throughout the element. 

2. Material field
The constitutive law we are using for this contraction is the
