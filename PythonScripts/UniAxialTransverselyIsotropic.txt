Documentation:
This script tries to replicate the old CMISS example of 10% uniaxial extension of a unit cube with fibres (30 degrees)


0. Initialise OpenCMISS 
Set error handling as TRAP_ERROR, and turn all levels of diagnostic testing on. 

1. Coordinate system
RC

2. Region. 

3. Basis functions
Use quadratic lagrange for pressure interpolation (because of volumetric locking) and cubic hermite for geometry. 

4. Mesh
generate cube mesh. 

5. Decomposition 
standard

6. Fibre field
For a transversely isotropic material, there is only one fibre component. This is set to be at 30 degrees to the xi1 direction. 30 degrees is given in radians. 

7. Material field
use the guccione transverse isotropic. There are 5 coefficients, and they are set as the same as found in the old CMISS example.
